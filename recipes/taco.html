        <h1>Taco Recipe</h1>
        <div class="pic"><img src="../imgs/taco.jpg" alt="ah darn"></div>
        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The taco is deceptively simple by reputation; tortilla, 
                filling, and perhaps some garnishes or salsa on top. 
                But the reality is that so much goes into the preparation 
                for the myriad fillings of the ubiquitous taco that to 
                dismiss this handheld meal as no more than street food 
                is a huge disservice. Mexican food is a UNESCO-designated 
                cultural treasure, and in the taco category, these vessels 
                of masa, meat or meat-like proteins and spice are widely 
                varied.</p>
            <p>But it's also easy to get lost among all the options to 
                stuff in tortillas and fall back on the basics. Which is 
                fine, but if you're not exploring the wide-world of taco
                 fillings, you're doing your palate a disservice. To give 
                 you the knowledge you need to live your best taco life, we
                  enlisted the expertise of Steven Alvarez, an assistant 
                  English professor at St. Johnâ€™s University in Queens who 
                  came to fame when he started teaching a taco literacy 
                  course at the University of Kentucky. We discussed the 
                  origins and mythology behind some of the most popular 
                  tacos around and came to the conclusion that it could 
                  very well take years of study to tell the stories of every
                   taco imaginable.</p>

            <li><p>1 cup shredded iceberg lettuce, optional</p></li>
            <li><p>1 large tomato, seeded and chopped, optional</p></li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Make a taco mold by rolling out aluminum foil and folding
                 it over in 10-inch increments until you have a 4-sheet-thick
                  piece of foil. Fold the large foil square in half horizontally,
                   bringing the bottom to the top, and then turn 90 degrees.
                    Crimp over the top and bottom edges by 1 inch, and then 
                    fold over the sides by 1 inch. Place the aluminum foil roll
                     or a narrow rolling pin into the center of the foil square 
                     and bring the sides together to create a hollow, narrow tube 
                     to mold the taco, making sure it can stand up on the long side. </p></li>
            <li><p>Heat the oven to 250 degrees F.</p></li>
            <li><p>Heat the peanut oil in a 12-inch cast iron skillet over medium 
                heat until it reaches 350 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer, 
                about 5 minutes. Adjust the heat to maintain the temperature. </p></li>
            <li><p>Shape 1 tortilla around the aluminum foil mold, forming a taco 
                shape. Use tongs to hold up the sides against the mold and put the
                 bottom of the tortilla into the hot oil and fry for 20 seconds.
                  Lay 1 side of the tortilla down in the hot oil and fry for 30 
                  seconds. Flip the tortilla over and fry for an additional 30 
                  seconds. Remove the taco shell to a cooling rack set over a 
                  newspaper lined half sheet pan and cool for 30 seconds before 
                  removing the mold. Sprinkle the hot tortillas with kosher salt, 
                  to taste. Repeat frying procedure with the remaining tortillas. 
                  Keep the taco shells warm in the heated oven while preparing the 
                  filling. </p></li>
            <li><p>Drain all but 2 tablespoons of the peanut oil from the skillet 
                and return to medium heat. Once the oil shimmers, add the onion and 
                cook until softened and lightly browned around the edges, 
                about 3 to 4 minutes. Add the ground meat, 1 teaspoon salt, and 
                garlic. Cook until browned, about 3 to 4 minutes, stirring 
                occasionally, to break up the meat. Add Taco Potion and beef broth. 
                Bring to a simmer and cook, uncovered, until sauce is slightly 
                thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. </p></li>
            <li><p>Assemble each taco with meat mixture, panela, jalapeno slices, 
                lettuce, tomatoes, and cilantro. Serve immediately. </p></li>
            <li><p>Put all of the ingredients in a small jar and shake to combine. 
                Store in an airtight container for up to 1 month.  </p></li>
        </ol>
