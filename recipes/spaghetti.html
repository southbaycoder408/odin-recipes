        <h2><p>Description</p></h2>

        <p>Spaghetti is the quintessential Italian Pasta. It is long - like a string - round 
            in cross -section and made from durun wheat semolina. Commercial varieties are generally 
            used, but artisanal versions are easy to find. This is the best known pasta shape in the 
            world, so much so that he name is identical in nearly every language.
        </p>
        <p>Originally, spaghetti was served like any other kind of pasta, with only olive oil 
            and cheese. Only at the beginning of the 18th century did spaghetti begin to be served 
            with tomato sauce. Today, spaghetti may be served with mear sauce, seagood, vegetables, 
            cheese or sausages. This is an extremely verstile dish, as often a good tomato sauce, a 
            dusting of lemon zest and a few fresh basil leaves will make a truly memorable first course.

        <h2>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><p>one 12-oz box Barilla spaghetti</p></li>
            <li><p>pinch salt, optional to taste</p></li>
            <li><p>1 lb. ground beef or ground sirloin</p></li>
            <li><p>one 24-oz jar Barilla Tomato and Basil Sauce or your favorit sauce</p></li>

            <li><p>freshly grated Parmesan cheese for garnishing, optional</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li><p>To a large pan, add the pasta, cover with 3 cups cold water, optional salt to taste, 
                and boil over high heat until water has absorbed, about 10 minutes, but watch your pasta 
                and cook as needed until al dente. While pasta boils, brown the ground beef.</p></li>
            <li><p>To a large skillet, add the ground beef and cook over medium-high heat, breaking up the 
                meat with a spatula as it cooks to ensure even cooking.</p></li>
            <li><p>After beef has cooked through, add the pasta sauce, stir to combine, and cook for 1 to 2 
                minutes, or until heated through.</p></li>
            <li><p>After pasta has cooked for about 10 minutes, or until all the water has been absorbed, 
                add the sauce over the pasta and toss to combine in the skillet or alternatively plate 
                the pasta and add sauce to each individual plate as desired.</p></li>
            <li><p>Optionally garnish with basil and Parmesan to taste and serve immediately. Pasta and sauce
                 are best warm and fresh but extra will keep airtight in the fridge for up to 5 days.</p></li>
