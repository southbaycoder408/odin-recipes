        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p class="desc">This summer our family spent a month in Southeast Asia. It was an amazing adventure 
            filled with colorful cultural experiences, breathtaking views, and dazzling dishes. 
            We ate well. Really well. Of all the meals we enjoyed in Thailand, the one that 
            surprised us the most was a light and lean soup, called Tom Yum.
        </p>
        <p class="desc">Tom Yum is a simple, but flavorful, soup made with fresh lemongrass, kaffir lime 
            leaves, fish sauce, chiles, and protein… Usually shrimp.And in Thailand, it’s 
            everywhere. EVERYWHERE. It’s the most popular soup, arguably the most popular recipe, 
            in the country. You cannot walk into a restaurant without spotting Tom Yum on the menu. 
            Therefore, we ate a lot of it. And we had the opportunity to make Tom Yum ourselves a 
            few times, with expert instruction.

            <li><p>kaffir lime leaves</p></li>
            <li><p>onion</p></li>
            <li><p>thai chilies</p></li>
            <li><p>galangal</p></li>
            <li><p>fish sauce</p></li>
            <li><p>mushrooms</p></li>
            <li><p>lime juice</p></li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Pop the Heads. As mentioned, whole shrimp with heads is a very important 
                ingredient, because you need to make “shrimp oil” to achieve the right flavor. 
                The oil is made from sauteeing shrimp heads in oil, to release the shrimp flavor 
                into the oil. Pull the heads off the shrimp and place them in a wok or large skillet. </p></li>
            <li><p>Sizzle. Add the oil to the skillet. Add a good pinch of salt. Sauté the shrimp 
                heads in the oil, cooking until they are red and crispy, and the oil is red as well.</p></li>
            <li><p>Smash. Trim the lemongrass stalks and galangal. Use a meat mallet or the side of
                 a knife to smash the lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves, onion, chilies, and galangal.
                  This helps release their flavors into the broth. </p></li>
            <li><p>Simmer. Place the aromatics in a medium soup pot and add water. Simmer for 
                5-10 minutes, until the broth smells fresh and fragrant.</p></li>
            <li><p>Shrimp It Up. Stir in the mushrooms, shrimp, and fish sauce. Simmer just long 
                enough for the shrimp to cook.</p></li>
            <li><p>Shrimp Oil. Stir in the shrimp oil and lime juice. Then throw the heads away.</p></li>
        </ol>
